# 4.0 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 Plan Introduction
SafeNet is an application that aims to ease the stress of traveling with the freedom of personalized exploration. Within the application users can create "parties" with a group of users on their friends list. The user that created the party will be the party leader and can create a geo-fence, called a "SafeNet", of their preference. This application will then keep track on all party members within the geo-fence and will notify the party leader when a member has left the "SafeNet". This application will target and try to best aid teachers in tracking their students during field trips and other such outings.

## 4.3 Project Organization
Since this is my own project with only me as the team, there is no team organization. However, I will work on the project in the order of setting up the database, creating the front-end, and then adding functionality. I will be working on my own but also will give weekly updates during class on my progress and the difficulties I encounter. 

## 4.4 Project Schedule
The have a list of features that must completed for a minimum viable product which are detailed in the GANTT Chart. All development is done on iOS and is detailed in the hardware resources.
